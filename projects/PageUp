# Project PageUp  
**Exploring swipe-based interaction for long-form mobile reading**

**Type:** Self-initiated product MVP  
**Platform:** Mobile web  
**Role:** End-to-end product ownership (problem framing → MVP → instrumentation)

---

## Problem

Reading long-form text on mobile devices often feels cognitively heavy, especially for short, frequent reading sessions. Existing e-book readers are optimized for page-based or scroll-based interactions, which don’t align well with mobile-native gesture habits shaped by short-form media.

The core question was not about content quality or attention span, but about **interaction design**.

---

## Hypothesis

**Primary hypothesis**  
Long-form text may feel less cognitively heavy on mobile if content is broken into discrete chunks and navigated via familiar vertical swipe gestures.

**Counter-hypothesis**  
Chunking could disrupt narrative flow or feel artificial for deep readers.

The MVP was designed as an experiment to observe real usage rather than assume either outcome.

---

## MVP scope (what “done” meant)

The MVP was intentionally scoped to test interaction quality, not to resemble a complete reading product.

- Vertical swipe-based navigation (forward / backward)
- Mobile Safari compatibility
- Real long-form content access via:
  - Preloaded clean Chapter 1 of *The Great Gatsby*
  - Optional EPUB upload
- Variable text density (Less / Medium / More)
- Reading progress indicators
- Basic resume state on the same device
- Session-level instrumentation for behavioral signals

Non-goals included backend systems, accounts, personalization, annotations, and monetization.

## Key product decisions

- **Swipe vs. scroll or pagination**  
  Chose vertical swipe to align with existing mobile muscle memory and create discrete reading units.

- **Text density as a variable, not a constant**  
  Exposed chunk size as a controllable parameter to study its effect on pacing and comfort.

- **Defaults before configuration**  
  Users start with a medium density to establish a baseline, avoiding upfront decision fatigue.

- **Controlled content input**  
  Instead of over-engineering EPUB parsing, provided a clean, preloaded chapter to reduce early friction and preserve experimental signal.

- **Explicit session boundaries**  
  Designed clear start/end points so engagement metrics reflected deliberate reading behavior.

---

## Instrumentation (session-level)

Metrics were captured per session using lightweight Google Form integration, triggered by user actions.

**Signals tracked**
- Session start / end timestamps
- Device type
- Total pages read
- Last page index
- Progress percentage
- Total reading time
- Average time per page
- Text density usage (last setting + time spent per mode)

The goal was **directional learning**, not statistical certainty.

---

## Learnings (pre-launch)

- Separating the experiment from the solution helped prevent scope drift into adjacent problems.
- Defaults materially shape behavior and must be treated as part of experiment design.
- Defining metrics early clarified which questions the MVP could and could not answer, reducing overbuilding.

---

## Next steps (data-dependent)

- Release to a small group and analyze depth, pacing, drop-off, and density patterns.
- Refine default text density based on observed behavior.
- Evolve resume state only if repeat usage indicates sustained reading intent.
- Improve EPUB normalization only if engagement differs meaningfully from controlled content.
- Re-evaluate platform direction after learning stabilizes.
